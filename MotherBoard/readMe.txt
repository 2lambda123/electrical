Notes for Motherboard files.

*** Schematic ***
BBB headers will be shown true to pins because pinouts are not 
   set and updating the headers will be annoying.

Signals for MUX pins will be denoted with labels instead of wire 
   connections for flexibility and cleanliness.     

*** hyperLib ***
A and B designator for CD74HC4067 designate pinout orientation
   A is true to the physical pins, B is to show purpose/flow.
